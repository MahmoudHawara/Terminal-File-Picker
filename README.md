# Open File Dialogues in C++ Without GUI

Are you looking for a simple and efficient way to open file dialogues in C++ without Graphical User Interfaces? Look no further! My code provides a streamlined solution for handling file input without the need for any GUIs.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure that you have `g++` installed on your system. If it's not already installed, you can download it from the official website or install it using a package manager.

## Getting Started
Once you have `g++` installed on your system, navigate to the directory where you've saved the `main.cpp` file and run the following command to convert the code into an executable file:

```sh
g++ main.cpp -o main.exe -lcomdlg32
```

This will generate an executable file that you can run on your system.

## Using the Program
To use My code, simply execute the generated executable file. Pressing 1 will open a file dialogue window that lets you choose your input file. The selected file path will be printed on the screen for your convenience. If you're unsure what to do next, pressing any key other than 1 will remind you to press 1 to browse.

## Benefits
By eliminating the need for complicated Graphical User Interfaces, My code simplifies the process of managing files and reduces the risk of errors. My hope that this code proves to be a valuable tool in streamlining your file management tasks and minimizing your workload.
